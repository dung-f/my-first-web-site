    target = "_blank" title = "html5 specification">Web</a> is a computer programming system created by Donald E.
    <br>Knuth as the first implementation of what he called "literate programming":
    <br>the idea that one could create software as works of literature,
    <br>by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse
    <br>(as is common practice in most programming languages),
    <br>in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers,
    <br>rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.</p>
